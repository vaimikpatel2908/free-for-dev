### Free SaaS Offering Submission

Thank you for contributing to this list. This list is for **SaaS**
services that offer a **free tier** to help developers evaluate and
build something that users can later use and get support for.

The focus of this list is quite broad but we try to keep things
limited to that which infrastructure developers, like DevOps Practitioners,
would find useful.

This list is the result of more than a thousand people contributing
to make something useful, we appreciate your efforts.

NOTES:
  * We do not anymore accept cPanel like PHP+MySQL hosting services.
